After solving the task, make a connection with terminology from object-oriented languages.

Which elements of your solution would correspond to object:
    1. data fields
    2. methods
    3. virtual methods
    4. constructors

1. Object data fields correspond to structure variables

2. Object methods correspond to regular C functions
   C doesn't allow function definition within structures, but you
   can add function pointers to the structure that represents an Object.

3. Object virtual methods correspond to the function pointer arrays
   that I created for each Object type (dog_table, cat_table)

4. Object constructors correspond to the constructDog and constructCat functions
