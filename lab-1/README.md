### Task 1
Demonstrate dynamic polymorphism in C

### Task 2
Recreate a C++ program with classes, inheritance, static, virtual
and non-virtual functions using C

### Task 3
Examine the memory requirements of classes with and without virtual
methods. Discuss the size differences

### Task 4
This exercise looks at the time cost of dynamic polymorphism.
Analyze assembly code and discuss the differences in the number
of instructions when executing virtual and non-virtual methods

### Task 5
The goal of this exercise is to show that we can call the virtual methods
of objects without using their symbolic names, assuming that the pointer
to the virtual table is at the very beginning of the object.

### Task 6
This exercise demonstrates the different behavior of polymorphic
calls during and after the construction of the object is complete.
Explain program output by analyzing the compiled machine code.
