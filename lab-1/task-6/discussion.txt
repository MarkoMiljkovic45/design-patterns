Explain the program output by analyzing the compiled machine code.
Note who, when, and where sets/modifies the pointer to the virtual function table.

int main()
{
    Derived* pd = new Derived();
    pd->method();
}

Output:
    Method says: I'm the base implementation
    Method says: I'm the derived implementation
    Method says: I'm the derived implementation

The order of execution:

Derived* pd = new Derived(); => 1. Derived() //Constructor
                                2. Base()    //Constructor
                                3. Base::method()
                                4. Base::virtualMethod()
                                5. Derived::method()
                                6. Derived::method()


pd->method(); results in:    => 7. Derived::method()
                                8. Derived::virtualMethod()
